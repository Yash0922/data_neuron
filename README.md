# Responsive Resizable Layout with React

## Overview

This project is a React-based web application that implements a responsive, resizable layout with three different components. Users can resize the components by dragging their sides, and neighboring components will automatically adjust. The application includes user authentication and integrates with a backend API for data management.

## Features

* **Three-Component Layout**: The layout consists of three components, each with its own content.
* **Resizable Components**: Users can resize the components by dragging their sides.
* **Responsive Neighboring Components**:  Neighboring components adjust automatically based on resizing.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts smoothly to different laptop screen sizes.
* **API Integration**: The application communicates with a backend API for:
    * Adding, updating, and tracking counts of these operations
* **Local Storage**: Data persists across page reloads using local storage.
* **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to access the application's features.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React.js
    * react-rnd (for resizable components)
    * Axios (for API calls)
    * React Router DOM (for client-side routing)
    * jwt-decode (for token decoding)
    * CSS (for styling)
* **Backend:** [https://github.com/Yash0922/DataNerounbackend.git](https://github.com/Yash0922/DataNerounbackend.git) 

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* A running instance of the backend API (see backend link above).

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the frontend repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<frontend-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd <frontend-repo-name> 
   npm install 
   ```

3. **Configure backend API URL (if necessary):**
   * Locate the file where API calls are made.
   * Update the base URL to match your backend API's address. 

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## User Authentication
The application includes functionality for user sign-in and login. Users can access the main layout and data management features only after logging in.

### Sign-in
The `Signup` component allows users to create a new account by providing a username and password. The application uses the provided credentials to authenticate the user and store the necessary information (such as a JWT token) in the local storage.

### Login
The `Login` component allows users to log in to the application using their credentials. The application verifies the user's credentials and stores the necessary information (such as a JWT token) in the local storage.

## Deployment
The application can be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. The deployment process will depend on the platform you choose.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive, resizable layout using React and the react-rnd library. The application also integrates with an API for data management, utilizes local storage for data persistence, and includes user authentication functionality. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own use case.
