# Responsive Resizable Layout with React

## Overview
This project is a React-based web application that implements a responsive, resizable layout with three different components. Users can resize the components by dragging the sides, and the neighboring components will automatically expand or shrink accordingly. The application also includes functionality for user authentication, allowing users to sign in and log in.

## Features
1. **Three-Component Layout**: The layout consists of three different components, each with its own content (HTML or images).
2. **Resizable Components**: Users can resize the components by dragging the sides.
3. **Responsive Neighboring Components**: The neighboring components expand or shrink based on the resizing operations performed on the target component.
4. **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive on all laptop devices.
5. **API Integration**: The application integrates with an API to handle data management, including adding, updating, and tracking the counts of these operations.
6. **Local Storage**: The application stores the data in the local storage, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.
7. **User Authentication**: The application includes functionality for user sign-in and login.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- react-rnd (for resizable components)
- Axios (for API calls)
- React Router DOM (for client-side routing)
- jwt-decode (for token decoding)
- CSS (for styling)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. **Start the Development Server**: Run `npm start` to start the development server and launch the application in your default browser.

```

- `components/`: Contains the main components used in the application, such as the `Home`, `Login`, and `Signup` components.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions, such as the `getUser` function from `auth.js` and API-related functions in `api.js`.
- `App.js`: The main application component.
- `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `package.json`: The project configuration file, including dependencies and scripts.

## User Authentication
The application includes functionality for user sign-in and login. Users can access the main layout and data management features only after logging in.

### Sign-in
The `Signup` component allows users to create a new account by providing a username and password. The application uses the provided credentials to authenticate the user and store the necessary information (such as a JWT token) in the local storage.

### Login
The `Login` component allows users to log in to the application using their credentials. The application verifies the user's credentials and stores the necessary information (such as a JWT token) in the local storage.

## Deployment
The application can be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. The deployment process will depend on the platform you choose.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive, resizable layout using React and the react-rnd library. The application also integrates with an API for data management, utilizes local storage for data persistence, and includes user authentication functionality. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own use case.
